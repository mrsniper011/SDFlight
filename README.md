SDFlight
========

SDFlight is an arduino-based project that I've been working on since January 2014. This project uses custom-built gps tracking hardware based on arduino and adafruit's "ultimate gps module", and software for the purposes of flight-training. None of the hardware/software is or should be certified by a governing body for aviation. The goal is improving a pilot's skills, and not for assigning blame or determining if someone is breaking rules.
The Ultimate GPS module from adafruit, hopefully mixed with a few other sensors will allow for extremely accurate position data. Using this you can determine ways to improve flying, particularily when it comes to cross-country or circuit/pattern operations.
